        <h1>BURUDIH DAM</h1>
        <p>
            Burudi Dam was built in the scenic surroundings of Dalma  Hills during the British era. It is popular picnic spot for the people of Jharkhand and West Bengal. As the dam is surrounded by the beautiful Dalma hills, you will find it more splendid. <br>
            Burudi Dam is located in the Ghatsila subdivision of the East Singhbhum, district Jharkhand. <br><br>

            Best time to visit Burudi Dam is in the month of October. Also in this time you will get to witness the Binda Mela. This mela takes place by the bank of the lake for 15 days where you can buy some beautiful handcrafts made by the tribal people living there.

        <h1>MUKTADHARA NATURE RESORT</h1>
        <p>
            Muktadhara nature resort is situated amidst the mesmerizing forest of the famous tourist destination of Ghatsila at Jharkhand. Spread across 45 acres of tree lands besides the Khrasroti River with 25000 trees within the property makes the place blissful paradise for its visitors. The beautiful long pathway beneath the long green trees beside the Kharasroti river has created an unforgetable bonding with all visitors. <br><br>

            If you are a nature lover then it is one of the best palce to visit, (personal POV- nice place to freshen your mood). It has a nursery also. There is a park for children where they can enjoy to the fullest.

        <h1>PHULDUNGRI HILL</h1>
        <p>
            Located only 2km away from the heart of Ghatsila. Phuldungri hill is a lovely place for sightseeing. When you reach at the top of the hillock, you can see the entire city very vividly. You can even drive to the top using the spiral pathway. <br><br>
            
            Best time to visit the sight is during the time of sunrise or during the time of sunset. <br>
            If you are a type of person who like to do adventurous things then you can trek to the top of the hillock ( During trek remember to take some snacks and a water bottle otherwise you will be exhausted).

        <h1>NARWA FOREST</h1>
        <p>
            Located quite close to the famous Rankinin Mandir, in Ghatsila. It is  one of the best place to visit in Ghatsila. This site is quite beautiful in a simplest way, with small creeks and flowy river (nice place to gether your thoughts). One of the best place to go there with your loved one. A place to relaxation. You can go for a picnic with your close ones. <br>
            To go there you need to rent a car or a rickshaw. <br><br>
            
            Avoid going there at night. 
        </p>

        <h1>DHARAGIRI WATERFALLS</h1>
        <p>
            One of the great place to visit while you are in tour at ghatsila. You can travel there while exploring Burudih Dam. This is located quite close to the Dam. If you visit there in monsoon season, you will witness the cascading water falling at a high density, though the fall's altitude is only 25  feet.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/IMG_9.jpg" alt="">
        
        <h1>RANKINI KALI TEMPLE</h1>
        <p>Located in Ghatsila and is dedicated to Goddess Kali. This temple is quite famous among both the locals and the toursits visits there. People believe that the temple is entirely spiritual. They worship Goddess Kali to fulfill their desires. If you are the type of person who believes in God (spiritual) I suggest you should visit this place. <br><br>
            
            In order to go there I suggest you to rent a car otherwise you will have to face the diffuculty in returning to Ghatsila.

        <h1>RATMOHANA</h1>
        <p>
            Apart from Phuldungri hillock, Ratmohana is the perfect place to see the sunset and sunrise in Ghatsila. When you reach the top of the hill, you will see the grogeous river Suvarnarekha flowing. Moreover the site is surrounded by massive trees like Sal, Simul, Amla, etc. This the place where you can genuinely love to see the sunset (you may fall in love with Ghatsila).
